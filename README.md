# C - printf

Group _printf project


## Description
Our goal is to create our own _printf function in groups that works like the original _printf function.
In C language, printf() function is used to print formatted output to the standard output stdout.  The printf function is a part of the C standard library <stdio.h> and it can allow formatting the output in numerous ways. The printf in C also contains a format specifier that is replaced by the actual value during execution.
## The compilation command
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 -Wno-format *.c
## Requirements
- Permitted text editors include Vi, Vim, and Emacs.
- Ensure that code adheres to the Betty style.
- Avoid the use of global variables.
- Restrict the number of functions in a file to no more than 5.
- Include the prototypes of all functions in your header file, named main.h. 
- Employ include guards for all your header files.
We were allowed to edit files in Vi, Vim or Emacs. Code should pass Betty style
