# C - printf

Group _printf project


## Description
Our goal is to create our own _printf function in groups that works like the original _printf function.
In C language, printf() function is used to print formatted output to the standard output stdout.  The printf function is a part of the C standard library <stdio.h> and it can allow formatting the output in numerous ways. The printf in C also contains a format specifier that is replaced by the actual value during execution.
